Remember, such titles were popular before computers were capable of rendering even halfway decent graphics.Yes, some people probably have fantastic memories of playing these games back in the day, but I'm certainly not one of them. Now if you've somehow never played a text-based game, well, they are somewhat similar to short stories. Meaning, you have to solve a central mystery by opening doors or exploring certain locations.Of course, you had to carefully craft text instructions for the game to follow that you typed using your, yes, (gasp!) keyboard. How well you crafted those instructions determined how well you did in the game. Now if you are actually one of those gamers who really enjoyed text-based games in the past, some developers from Argentina known as \"The Cabrera Brothers\" are working on coding a new text-based game with a cyberpunk theme. The game is called\u00a0Cypher: a Cyberpunk Text Adventure and seems like a classic 80s text title meshed with modern video game cut scenes.",

This calculation is made very efficient by the use of statistical algorithms which allow the ion to make jumps between calculated collisions and then averaging the collision results over the intervening gap. During the collisions, the ion and atom have a screened Coulomb collision, including exchange and correlation interactions between the overlapping electron shells. The ion has long range interactions creating electron excitations and plasmons within the target. These are described by including a description of the target's collective electronic structure and interatomic bond structure when the calculation is setup (tables of nominal values are supplied). The charge state of the ion within the target is described using the concept of effective charge, which includes a velocity dependent charge state and long range screening due to the collective electron sea of the target.",

The Airborne Assault series has made a point of reflecting this and Conquest of the Aegean is no exception. As the name of the game suggests, Conquest of the Aegean primarily concentrates on the WWII battles for Greece and Crete.
